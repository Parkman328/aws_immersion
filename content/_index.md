__The Objective of this tutorial is to get introductory hands-on experience using Qlik Data Integration Tools not to become an expert at using Qlik Replicate.__

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Qlik Replicate to ingest and deliver data in real-time to your various environments. Follow the step-by-step tutorial to quickly load sample data from a MySQL database into your PostgresSQL data warehouse, then watch as data updates happen in real time.  Due to cost and timing this tutorial runs in a single EC2 environment setup with Qlik Replicate and Docker for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Kafka.

## Overview
Objectives:

* Learn how to Configure Qlik Replicate to Work with Source and Target Endpoints.
* Learn how to Design Qlik Replicate Tasks.
* Learn how to MonitorQlik Replicate Tasks.

Our Tutorials will consist of 1 demo to get students to understand the flow of Qlik Replicate and have 2 real life scenarios for students get hands on experience with Qlik Replicate.

While the tutorial scenario quickly highlights the concept of data ingestion and streaming to PostgresSQL,Kafka,and Amazon Redshift there are additional tuning that can be done to make gin efficiency. 
Qlik Replicate can also deliver any data from popular relational database systems, mainframes, or SAP applications that you might have in your enterprise.

In addition, at the end of the tutorial you should check out Qlik Compose, our Data Warehousing Automation solution that can automate the process of creating and updating analytics-ready data sets in Amazon Redshift.
