__The Objective of this tutorial is to get introductory hands-on experience using Qlik Data Integration Tools not to become an expert at using Qlik Replicate.__

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Qlik Replicate to ingest and deliver data in real-time to your various environments. Follow the step-by-step tutorial to quickly load sample data from a MySQL database into your PostgresSQL data warehouse, then watch as data updates happen in real time.  Due to cost and timing this tutorial runs in a single EC2 environment setup with Qlik Replicate and Docker for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and PGAdmin.
