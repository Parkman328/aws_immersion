# Welcome to Qlik Tutorial for AWS Immersion Day 2021! 
________________________________________________________________

##### The Objective of Tutorial is to get hands-on experience using Qlik Data Integration Tools not to become an expert at using Qlik Replicate.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Qlik Replicate (formerly Attunity Replicate) to ingest and deliver data in real-time to your various environment. Follow the step-by-step tutorial to quickly load sample data from a MySQL database into your PostgresSQL data warehouse, then watch as data updates happen in real time.  Due to cost and timing this tutorial runs in an Single EC2 envirooment setup with Qlik Replicate and Docker for MySQL, PostgreSQL, PGAdmin.

## Overview
Actual Tutorial  Consist of Three Parts:
* Part 1 Configuring Qlik Replicate
